    <p> Hey Mama, this website is so special for me. Ipdi oru website unakaga.. Una enaku avlo pidikum. Ne ilama oru life I can't imagine. Nama marriage kaaga, nama life journey kaaga romba wait pantruken papa. Namakula evlo sandai vanthalum, namaloda future yosicha ithulam onume ila ammu ma. Nama marriage life kandipa nalla irukum. Na epome unaku respect kudupen mama. Entha idathalayum vitum kuduka maten. <br> <br> I always trust in this "Never marry a rich men, Get rich together" we will definetly set example for it. Our romance is just going out of the world after every fight. The bond between us is so cute and lovely that every pair is dreaming for it. We will definitely do it. Namala parthu thappa pesinavangaluku lam nama prove pananum nama love. Kandipa nama panuvom. The day you said that you have feelings for me, I never thought that we would become so close. These days are moving tough lets stay strong together.<br> Sending you lots of love, hugs and kisses <br> <br>
    I love you mama</p>
